a.  

```{r}

  fit(weight ~ habit, data = births14_habitgiven)

tidy(wt_habit_fit)
```

b.  

$$ \hat{y} = 7.27 + -0.59\times smoker $$

c.  The expected weight of babies born to non-smoker mothers is the difference between the median weight of smoker and non-smoker babies, is 7.27 pounds. This intercept is meaningful because women in the sample can be non-smokers, and 7.27 lbs is a possible weight of a newborn.

d.  Babies born to smokers are, on average, about 0.59 pounds less than non-smoker mothers.
