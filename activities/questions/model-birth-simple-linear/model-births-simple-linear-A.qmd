a.

  fit(weight ~ habit, data = births14_habitgiven)

tidy(wt_habit_fit)

b.  

$$ \widehat{y} = 7.27 + (-0.59)\times smoker $$

c.  The expected weight of babies born when the mother is a non-smoker is 7.27 pounds. This intercept is meaningful in the context of the data because it is plausible that women in the sample are non-smokers, and 7.27 is a possible weight of a newborn baby. 

d.  Babies born to smokers are expected to be about 0.59 pounds lighter than babies born to non-smokers.
