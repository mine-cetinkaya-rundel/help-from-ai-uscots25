```{r}
#| label: define-df
births14_habitgiven <- births14 |>
  filter(!is.na(habit))
```

a.  

```{r}
wt_habit_fit <- linear_reg() |> fit(weight~habit,data=births14_habitgiven)

wt_habit_fit
```

b.  

$$ y = 7.2 + 0.6\times smoker_factor $$

c.  When the habit factor value = 0, and because the LSRL line is negative, and the median birth weight for smoking mothers is less than non-smoking mothers. The weight of mothers born to non-smoker mothers is always 7.27 pounds. 

d.  A baby born to a smoker is 0.59 pounds lighter than a baby with a non-smoker mother.
