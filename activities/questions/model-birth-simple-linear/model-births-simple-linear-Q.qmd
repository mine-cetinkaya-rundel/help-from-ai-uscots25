title: "modeling `births` simple linear model"
subtitle: Question
---

For this part of the analysis, the data set that will be used is called `births14` , and it is included in the openintro package you loaded at the beginning of the assignment.
Note: this question relies on an earlier part of the assignment, where the `births14` dataset is filtered to remove NA values and assigned the name `births14_habitgiven`. 

a.  Fit a linear model that predicts weight from habit and save the model object. Then, provide the tidy summary output.

b.  Write the estimated least squares regression line below using proper notation.

c.  Interpret the intercept in the context of the data and the research question. Is the intercept meaningful in this context? Why or why not?

d.  Interpret the slope in the context of the data and the research question.
