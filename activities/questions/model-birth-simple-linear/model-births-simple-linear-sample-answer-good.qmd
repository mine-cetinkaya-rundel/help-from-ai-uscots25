```{r}
#| label: define-df
births14_habitgiven <- births14 |>
  filter(!is.na(habit))
```

a.  

```{r}
wt_habit_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(weight ~ habit, data = births14_habitgiven)

tidy(wt_habit_fit)
```

b.  

$$ \widehat{weight} = 7.27 - 0.59 \times smoker $$

c.  The expected weight of babies born to non-smoker mothers is 7.27 pounds. This intercept is meaningful because it is plausible that women in the sample are non-smokers, and 7.27 lbs is a possible weight of a newborn baby. 

d.  Babies born to smokers are, on average, about 0.59 pounds lighter than babies with non-smoker mothers.
