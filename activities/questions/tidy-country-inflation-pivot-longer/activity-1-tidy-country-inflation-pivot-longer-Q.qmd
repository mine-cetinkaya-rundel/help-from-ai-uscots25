For this question you will work with inflation data from various countries in the world over the last 30 years.
The dataset is called `country-inflation.csv` and it's in your `data` folder.
Below is a peek at the data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
country_inflation <- read_csv("data/country-inflation.csv")
datatable(country_inflation, options = list(dom = 'tp')) |>
    formatRound(2:32, 2)
```

<br>

Reshape (pivot) `country_inflation` such that each row represents a country/year combination, with columns `country`, `year`, and `annual_inflation`.
Then, display the resulting data frame and state how many rows and columns it has.
