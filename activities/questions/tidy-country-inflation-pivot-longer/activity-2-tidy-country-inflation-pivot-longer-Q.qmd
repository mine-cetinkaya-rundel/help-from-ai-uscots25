For this question you will work with inflation data from various countries in the world over the last 30 years.
The dataset is called `country-inflation.csv` and it's in your `data` folder.

Reshape (pivot) `country_inflation` such that each row represents a country/year combination, with columns `country`, `year`, and `annual_inflation`.
Then, display the resulting data frame and state how many rows and columns it has.
