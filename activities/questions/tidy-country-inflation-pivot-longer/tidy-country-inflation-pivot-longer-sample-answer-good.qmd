country_inflation <- read_csv(here::here("data", "country-inflation.csv"))
```

The data frame, "yearly_inflation," has 1,178 rows and three columns.

```{r}
#| label: q4
yearly_inflation <- country_inflation |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `1993`:`2023`,
    names_to = "year",
    names_transform = as.numeric,
    values_to = "annual_inflation"
  )

yearly_inflation
```
