The expected weight of babies born to non-smoker mothers is 7.27 pounds. This intercept is meaningful because it is plausible that women in the sample are non-smokers, and 7.27 lbs is a possible weight of a newborn baby. \n\nd.  Babies born to smokers are, on average, about 0.59 pounds lighter than babies with non-smoker mothers. \n",
