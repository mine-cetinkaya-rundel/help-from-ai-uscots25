The expected weight of babies born to non-smoker mothers is the difference between the median weight of smoker and non-smoker babies, is 7.27 pounds. This intercept is meaningful because women in the sample can be non-smokers, and 7.27 lbs is a possible weight of a newborn.\n\nd.  Babies born to smokers are, on average, about 0.59 pounds less than non-smoker mothers. ",
