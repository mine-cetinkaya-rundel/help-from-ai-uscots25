The expected weight of babies born when the mother is a non-smoker is 7.27 pounds. This intercept is meaningful in the context of the data because it is plausible that women in the sample are non-smokers, and 7.27 is a possible weight of a newborn baby. \n\nd.  Babies born to smokers are expected to be about 0.59 pounds lighter than babies born to non-smokers.",
